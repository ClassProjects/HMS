<h1>About</h1>

<p>HMS was created under the need of having a simple, unified medical system for all of our users. We aim to solve
the problem of misplacing patient information once and for all. With this system participating Doctors, Hospitals
and Patients can easily locate a patient's medical history. This makes the process of starting tratments for these 
patients dramatically faster.</p>

<h3>All Your History, Here.</h3>
<p>Quick access to your past medical history and safeguard for all your future checkups. Helping
your Doctors help you.</p>

<h3>Doctors</h3>
<p>If you are a Doctor interested in becoming a participant in our system please contact our administating panel 
to recieve approval for your profile.</p>

<h3>Patients</h3>
<p>Any person is free to sign up as a patient to start using our services.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
